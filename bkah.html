                    <p>Built entirely with hand tools including chisels, hand planes, and scrapers. The process required careful attention to wood grain direction, thickness graduations, and precise joinery without modern conveniences.</p>

                    <p>Sourced traditional tonewoods: European spruce for the soundboard, flamed maple for back and sides, and ebony for the fingerboard. Each piece was selected for grain quality and acoustic properties.</p>
                    <p>Working without templates or power tools meant developing techniques for consistent thickness and contour. The biggest challenge was achieving the proper arch graduation for optimal sound projection.</p>

                    <p>The finished violin produces a warm, balanced tone suitable for folk and classical music. While not professional-grade, it demonstrates the feasibility of traditional construction methods.</p>
                    <p>This project taught patience, precision, and respect for traditional craftsmanship. Total cost was under $200 compared to $1000+ for equivalent store-bought instruments.</p>
