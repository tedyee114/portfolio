                    <p>By twisting together various metals, alloys can be formed during deposition that cannot be commercially purchased as wire for feedstock. In particular, the near-equal concentrations are good for making High Entropy Alloys (HEA’s). A materials professor posed the project to manufacture large volumes of twisted feedstock and my senior engineering capstone group took it on.</p>

                    <p>Luthiery (the art of making and repairing stringed-instruments) is the pinnacle of fine mechanical woodworking. My violin had 30 pieces, with details smaller than a mm, requiring some very sharp planes, chisels, and files. Assembly and finishing was a complex process requiring hide-glue, steam bending, varnishing and tuning. I completed the whole project despite doubt from a group of lifelong woodworkers, and the finished violin is playable, if a bit unique.</p>

                    <p>I only had 6months at Wright-Pierce, so we were not able to fully automate the process. The conversion from .json files to spreadsheets still required manual work to apply the municipality’s layout and without training our own models, the process still required quality control. The project was considered a success and used for both tie-cards and other public-record entry, though variation in card layout remained a large issue.</p>
                    <p>At the end of my coop, I was the only intern to ever give a company-wide presentation, where I pitched  the process both for others to use and to defend its worth as an investment. My work was featured in a session at the New England Water Works Association annual conference.

                    <p>My final project in my masters-level class was the simulation of a rainshadow. A rainshadow (or orographic projection) is a weather phenomenon where moist air is forced upwards when passing over mountain ranges and subsequently cools and precipitates a lot, leaving only dry air to pass over the mountain range.</p>
